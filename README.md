# Service Provider Routing and Switching, Specialist (JNCIS-SP) (JN0-363) -- Labs

>"I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand." â€“ Confucius

>This work is still in progress (but I wanted the use of wi-ki to run through and document the different lab scenarios as I progress through the course) 

These labs are part of my preparation for [JNCIS-SP](https://www.juniper.net/gb/en/training/certification/tracks/service-provider-routing-switching/jncis-sp.html) certification. 
The intention is to create a series of readily available labs, encompassing all conceivable topics related to this exam track, that I am able to replicate in this virtualised environment."


The labs are broken down by [exam topics](https://www.juniper.net/gb/en/training/certification/tracks/service-provider-routing-switching/jncis-sp.html)

- [Protocol-Independent Routing](#protocol-independent-routing)
- [Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)](#open-shortest-path-first)
- [Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)](#intermediate-system-to-intermediate-system)
- [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](#border-gateway-protocol)
- [Layer 2 Bridging or VLANs](#layer-2-bridging)
- [Spanning-Tree Protocols](#spanning-tree-protocols)
- [Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)](#multiprotocol-label-switching)
- [IPv6](#ipv6)
- [Tunnels](#tunnels)
- [High Availability](#high-availability)

Using Makefile, each lab is set up with the appropriate topology and foundational configuration using Containerlab, in conjunction with Ansible and a selection of other scripts and tools. The base configuration includes essential prerequisites like interface descriptions and IP assignments, enabling you to dive directly into the specific learning objectives in question.

## Protocol-Independent Routing

This lab covers the learning objectives for Protocol-Independent Routing.

This is the lab topology diagram:

![Topology](pictures/pir-topology.png)

Lab is deployed by running the following command:
```
make start-pir
```

Lab is destroyed by running the following command:
```
make stop-pir
```

### Objectives

- Static, aggregate, and generated routes
- Configuration and monitoring of static, aggregate, and generated routes
- Martian routes and how to add new entries to the default list
- Routing instances and their typical uses
- Configuration and sharing of routes between routing instances

---

## Open Shortest Path First

This lab covers the learning objectives for OSPF Routing.

This is the lab topology diagram:

![Topology](pictures/ospf-topology.png)
---

## Intermediate System to Intermediate System

This lab covers the learning objectives for ISIS Routing.

This is the lab topology diagram:

---

## Border Gateway Protocol

This lab covers the learning objectives for BGP.

> NOTE:
> This lab uses exaBGP that peers with `r3` to generate 172.16.%d.0/24 networks. Only requirement is to build the Docker image prior to deploying the lab. All files are located in ./docker folder. The Docker image is built from that folder with the following command:  docker build -t bgp-isp .

eBGP peering with `r3` and `isp1` is part of the base config and deployed when the lab starts. The routes should be received on `r3` but not accepted yet, leaving the options of required filtering to the actual labs.

### Objectives
- BGP basic operation
- BGP message types
- Attributes
- Route/path selection process
- Internal and external BGP (IBGP and EBGP) functionality and interaction
- Groups and peers
- Additional basic options
- Routing policy application
