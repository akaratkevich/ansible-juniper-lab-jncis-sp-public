# Service Provider Routing and Switching, Specialist (JNCIS-SP) (JN0-363) -- Labs

>"I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand." â€“ Confucius.

These labs are part of my preparation for [JNCIS-SP](https://www.juniper.net/gb/en/training/certification/tracks/service-provider-routing-switching/jncis-sp.html) certification. 
The intention was to create a series of readily available labs, encompassing all conceivable topics related to this exam track, that I was able to replicate in this virtualised environment."


The labs are broken down by [exam topics](https://www.juniper.net/gb/en/training/certification/tracks/service-provider-routing-switching/jncis-sp.html)

- [Protocol-Independent Routing](#protocol-independent-routing)
- [Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)](#open-shortest-path-first)
- [Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)](#intermediate-system-to-intermediate-system)
- [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](#border-gateway-protocol)
- [Layer 2 Bridging or VLANs](#layer-2-bridging)
- [Spanning-Tree Protocols](#spanning-tree-protocols)
- [Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)](#multiprotocol-label-switching)
- [IPv6](#ipv6)
- [Tunnels](#tunnels)
- [High Availability](#high-availability)

Using Makefile, each lab is set up with the appropriate topology and foundational configuration using Containerlab, in conjunction with Ansible and a selection of other scripts and tools. The base configuration includes essential prerequisites like interface descriptions and IP assignments, enabling you to dive directly into the specific learning objectives in question.

## Protocol-Independent Routing

The first lab covers the learning objectives for Protocol-Independent Routing.

This is the lab topology diagram:

![Topology](pictures/pir-topology.png)

Lab is deployed by running the following command:
```
make start-pir
```

Lab is destroyed by running the following command:
```
make stop-pir
```

>[!INFO]
> EXAM OBJECTIVES: Identiy the concepts, operation, and functionality of various protocol-independent routing components;

- Static, aggregate, and generated routes
- Martian addresses
- Routing instances, including routing information base (RIB) (also known as routing table) group
- Load balancing
- Filter-based forwarding

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Demonstrate knowledge of how to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot various protocol-independent routing components:

- Static, aggregate, and generated routes
- Load balancing
- Filter-based forwarding
```

### Objectives

- [Static](#static-routes), [aggregate, and generated routes](#aggregate-and-generated-routes);
- Configuration and monitoring of static, aggregate, and generated routes;
- Martian routes and how to add new entries to the default list;
- Routing instances and their typical uses;
- Configuration and sharing of routes between routing instances.

##### Static Route Default Options

Static routes are used in a networking environment for multiple purposes, including a default route for the autonomous system (AS) and as routes to customer networks. Unlike dynamic routing protocols, you manually configure the routing information provided by static routes on each router or multilayer switch in the network.

Starting state on `r1`
```

                    >  via lo0.0
```

##### Scenario 1 - simple static route

##### **Basic Next-Hop**:

All configuration for static routes occurs at the [edit routing-options] level of the hierarchy. A basic static route consists of a destination prefix and its associated next hop.

*Configuration*
```
anton@r1# show | compare 
[edit]
+  routing-options {
+      static {
+          route 10.100.100.2/32 next-hop 10.0.0.2;
+      }
+  }

[edit]
```

```
anton@r1# run show route 10.100.100.2 exact 

inet.0: 4 destinations, 4 routes (4 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
+ = Active Route, - = Last Active, * = Both

10.100.100.2/32    *[Static/5] 00:00:16
                    >  to 10.0.0.2 via ge-0/0/0.0
                    
```

##### Scenario 2 - qualified next-hop

##### **Qualified Next-Hop**:

With qualified next-hop, you can specify multiple next-hops for the same destination, each with different properties such as preference, weight, or color. This allows for more granular control over how traffic is routed to a destination.

The default preference value of static routes is 5. This preference makes them more likely to be active than OSPF, IS-IS, or BGP for matching prefixes. Use this option to increase the value of the static routes to prefer other sources of routing information.

*Configuration*
```
anton@r1# show | compare 
[edit]
+  routing-options {
+      static {
+          route 10.100.100.2/32 {
+              next-hop 10.0.0.2;
+              qualified-next-hop 10.20.20.2 {
+                  preference 6;
+              }
+          }
+    
```

In the sample configuration shown, the 10.0.0.2 next hop assumes the default static route preference of 5, whereas the qualified 10.20.20.2 next hop uses the defined route preference of 6. All traffic using this static route uses the 10.0.0.2 next hop unless it becomes unavailable. 

```
anton@r1> show route 10.100.100.2 exact    

inet.0: 6 destinations, 7 routes (6 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
+ = Active Route, - = Last Active, * = Both

10.100.100.2/32    *[Static/5] 00:00:19
                    >  to 10.0.0.2 via ge-0/0/0.0
                    [Static/6] 00:00:19
                    >  to 10.20.20.2 via ge-0/0/2.0
```

Static routes remain in the routing table until you remove them or until they become inactive. One possible scenario in which a static route becomes inactive is when the IP address used as the next hop becomes unreachable.

To test the qualified next-hop we can shutdown 'primary' interface on `r1`:
```
anton@r1# run show interfaces descriptions    
Interface       Admin Link Description
ge-0/0/0        down  down Link from R1 to R2 - primary
ge-0/0/2        up    up   Link from R1 to R2 - secondary

[edit]
anton@r1# run show route                      

inet.0: 5 destinations, 5 routes (5 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
+ = Active Route, - = Last Active, * = Both

10.0.0.1/32        *[Local/0] 00:00:11
                       Reject
10.20.20.0/24      *[Direct/0] 00:00:33
                    >  via ge-0/0/2.0
10.20.20.1/32      *[Local/0] 00:00:33
                       Local via ge-0/0/2.0
10.100.100.1/32    *[Direct/0] 01:56:09
                    >  via lo0.0
10.100.100.2/32    *[Static/6] 00:00:33
                    >  to 10.20.20.2 via ge-0/0/2.0

If no options are defined at the lower more specific hierarchy level the static routes will inherit the default options. 
Following options can be applied at the [routing-options static defaults] hierarchy:
```
[edit routing-options static defaults]
anton@r1# set ?
Possible completions:
  active               Remove inactive route from forwarding table
+ apply-groups         Groups from which to inherit configuration data
+ apply-groups-except  Don't inherit configuration data from these groups
> as-path              Autonomous system path
> color                Color (preference) value
> color2               Color (preference) value 2
+ community            BGP community identifier
  install              Install route into forwarding table
  longest-match        Always use longest prefix match to resolve next hops
> metric               Metric value
> metric2              Metric value 2
> metric3              Metric value 3
> metric4              Metric value 4
  no-install           Don't install route into forwarding table
  no-longest-match     Don't always use longest prefix match to resolve next hops
  no-readvertise       Don't mark route as eligible to be readvertised
  no-resolve           Don't allow resolution of indirectly connected next hops
  no-retain            Don't always keep route in forwarding table
  passive              Retain inactive route in forwarding table
> preference           Preference value
> preference2          Preference value 2
  readvertise          Mark route as eligible to be readvertised
  resolve              Allow resolution of indirectly connected next hops
  retain               Always keep route in forwarding table
> tag                  Tag string
> tag2                 Tag string 2
[edit routing-options static defaults]
```

For example lets set the default route preference at the defaults hierarchy and also at the route level:
*Configuration*
```
anton@r1# edit routing-options static 

[edit routing-options static]
anton@r1# show 
defaults {
    preference 14;
}
route 10.100.100.2/32 {
    next-hop 10.0.0.2;
    qualified-next-hop 10.20.20.2;
    preference 10;
}
route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 10.0.0.2;

[edit routing-options static]
```

```
anton@r1# run show route protocol static                 

inet.0: 7 destinations, 7 routes (7 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
+ = Active Route, - = Last Active, * = Both

0.0.0.0/0          *[Static/14] 00:01:36
                    >  to 10.0.0.2 via ge-0/0/0.0
10.100.100.2/32    *[Static/10] 00:04:23
                       to 10.0.0.2 via ge-0/0/0.0
                    >  to 10.20.20.2 via ge-0/0/2.0
```

#### Aggregate and generated routes

Aggregate routes allow you to combine groups of routes with common addresses into a single entry. By combining routes into a single entry, you can decrease the number of route advertisements sent by your device, thus decreasing the size of the routing tables maintained by neighboring devices. A second advantage of advertising a single route prefix that represents all other internal route prefixes is that internal routing instabilities can be hidden from external peers.

##### Scenario 1 - aggregated routes

We will split 172.20.0.0/24 into /29s and assign them to Lo0 on R3
*Configuration*
```
anton@r3# show | compare 
[edit interfaces lo0 unit 0 family inet]
        address 10.100.100.3/32 { ... }
+       address 172.20.0.1/29;
+       address 172.20.0.9/29;
+       address 172.20.0.17/29;
+       address 172.20.0.25/29;
+       address 172.20.0.33/29;
+       address 172.20.0.41/29;
+       address 172.20.0.249/29;
+       address 172.20.0.241/29;
+       address 172.20.0.233/29;
```

This is the current routing table on `r3`
```
anton@r3# run show route table inet.0 

inet.0: 21 destinations, 21 routes (21 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
+ = Active Route, - = Last Active, * = Both

```

When aggregating the routes we need to find the closest subnet that will cover all the routes:

Options are: 

*Overly broad aggregation can lead to routing anomalies*
172.20.0.0/26 - will cover the following: 172.20.0.1 - 62 
172.20.0.224/27 -  will cover the following: 172.20.0.225 - 254

or:

172.20.0.0/27 - will cover the following: 172.20.0.1 - 30
172.20.0.240/28  - will cover the following: 172.20.0.241 - 254
*Configuration*

##### Scenario 2 - aggregated routes redistribution

Although OSPF is not covered in this lab we will set up a quick OSPF between `r2` and `r3` and redistribute the aggregate to see the results

*Configuration*
```
anton@r2# run show configuration | match ospf | display set 
set policy-options policy-statement CONNECTED-TO-OSPF from protocol direct
set policy-options policy-statement CONNECTED-TO-OSPF then accept
set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface ge-0/0/1.0
set protocols ospf export CONNECTED-TO-OSPF
```

*Configuration*
```
anton@r3# run show configuration | match ospf | display set 
set policy-options policy-statement AGGREGATE-TO-OSPF from protocol aggregate
set policy-options policy-statement AGGREGATE-TO-OSPF then accept
set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface ge-0/0/1.0
set protocols ospf export AGGREGATE-TO-OSPF
```

```

As a result with static default route on `r1` towards `r2` and OSPF between `r2` and `r3` redistributing direct routes from `r2` to `r3` and aggregate routes from `r3` to `r2` we have a reachability between `r1` and loopbacks on `r3` (*that were aggregated*)
